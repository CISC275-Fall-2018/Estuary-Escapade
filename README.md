# Estuary Escapade
Estuary Escapade is a game created for Introduction to Software Engineering (CISC 275). The goal was to get used to how git and GitHub work as well as an AGILE development process.

## Game Description: 
With our game the player will play as a researcher and must identify different animals in the estuary. Once the player identifies an animal they will gain more information on the animal by completing various tasks. The goal is to identify a certain number of animals in a given time frame.

## Installation
Estuary Escapade is written entirely in Java so as long as you have Java installed it should work. Just clone the repo and do ``java Estuary-Escapade/src/controller/Controller.java``
